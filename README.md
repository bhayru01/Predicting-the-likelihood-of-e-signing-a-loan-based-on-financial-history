# Problem Statement
## Problem
Fintech company that specializes on loans offers low APR loanss to applicants
based on their financial habits, as almost all lending companies do. This company
has partnered with a P2P lending marketplace that provides real-time leads(loan applicants). The numbers of conversions from these leads are satisfactory.

The task is to create a model that predicts whether or not these leads will complete the electronic signature phase of the loan application(a.k.a. e_signed). The company seeks to leverage this model to identify less 'quality' applicants(e.g. those who are not responding to the onboarding process), and experiment with giving them different onboarning screens.
